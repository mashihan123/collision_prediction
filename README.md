Traffic Collision Prediction with GAT

Graph Attention Networks (GAT) are implemented for traffic accident prediction, where vehicles are represented as individual nodes in the graph and the vehicle classes serve as key node features. The prediction framework encompasses graph classification (predicting occurrence of a traffic accident) and collision time regression (estimating when the accident will occur). The GNN model achieves 86.1% accuracy in graph classification and an average error of 0.36 seconds in collision time regression. The prediction framework offers new opportunities for enhancing collision warnings and improving safety measures.
